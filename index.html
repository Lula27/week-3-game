	<p>Welcome one and all to a game of ingenious mind trickery! Do you have what it takes to beat the all-knowing machine? <br>
	Instructions: Guess what letter I'm thinking of by using your keyboard!</p> -->

<!-- Game involves user playing against computer  
user: guess letter 
	 win if correct (+1 point in "Wins")
	 loss if wrong  (+ 1 point in "Losses")
	 guesses left (start with 5 guesses -1 point in "Guesses Left")
	 Your Previous Guesses: list of letters user has already guessed

*Tips: 2.	When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page). 3.	When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
